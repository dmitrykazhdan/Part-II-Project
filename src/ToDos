- In "ProcessOntology", add a timeout for the "gen.getExplanations(entailment, 4);" step.

- In "GenerateTrees" add a timeout for the tree generator.

- In the "ProofTreeGenerator" class, in the "getLaconicJustifications" method, add a timeout step
when computing laconic justifications.

- Fixup cardinality lower bound handling. Avoid using string conversion. Incorporate within rule.

- Fixup excessive type-casting in pattern matching.

- Fixup "GroupExpression" pattern for equivalent classes and for disjoint classes.

- Implement exception rules.

- Implement generating rules.

- Implement restriction checking.

- Add a check for disjointness of data ranges, as given in the rules (e.g. Dr0 & Dr1 are disjoint)
