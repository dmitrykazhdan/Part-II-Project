Critical:

- Shutdown executor threads (for both tree generation and (just, ent) generation)

- Refactor code to make the ontology dir and output dir input parameters, not hardcoded.

- Do disjointness of data ranges.

- Edge case of rule 52 (and potentially others) if class expressions are equal.

- Add check if laconic axiom contains conclusion in practice should not happen. 
If size of justification > 1, then laconic can only through away 
parts, so must still have the same number of justification axioms

- Rule 56, unequal literals



Good-To-Have:

- False Negatives are easier to test than false positives.

- In "ProcessOntology", add a timeout for the "gen.getExplanations(entailment, 4);" step.

- In the "ProofTreeGenerator" class, in the "getLaconicJustifications" method, add a timeout step
when computing laconic justifications.

- Test ontology processing by providing a sample ontology and investigating what files will be derived from it.
Ensure to include edge cases of T <= A and A <= F.
