Critical:

- Add tests of generated trees (complicated cases).

- Add exception tests.

- Add tests where there should be no tree returned.



Good-To-Have:

- False Negatives are easier to test than false positives.

- Test ontology processing by providing a sample ontology and investigating what files will be derived from it.
Ensure to include edge cases of T <= A and A <= F.
