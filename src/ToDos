Critical:

- Shutdown executor threads (for both tree generation and (just, ent) generation)

- Refactor code to make the ontology dir and output dir input parameters, not hardcoded.

- Do disjointness of data ranges.


- Add tests of generated trees (complicated cases).

- Add exception tests.

- Add tests where there should be no tree returned.



Good-To-Have:

- False Negatives are easier to test than false positives.

- Test ontology processing by providing a sample ontology and investigating what files will be derived from it.
Ensure to include edge cases of T <= A and A <= F.
