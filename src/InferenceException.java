	 A set of expressions gets mapped onto another set, where every element of the second set is
	 	1. An element of the first set
	 	2. An element of the first set with a transformation applied
	 Note: some elements in set 1 may or may not be left out altogether.

	 This can be:
	 	1. Do nothing (add no other rules).
